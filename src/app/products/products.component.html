      <h3>Solid Vinyl Safety Covers</h3>
      <img src="./assets/covers/cover1.jpg" alt="Safety Covers For Imperial Pools" align="left" hspace="4">
      <p>Our solid cover creates a complete barrier to sunlight, dirt, debris, and water. Heavy-duty construction provides protection from the elements and prevents algae growth. That means less work and a faster spring pool opening. An optional pump or drain panel is required to meet ASTM safety standards.</p>
